## Setup 
- Download Chinese Mandarin `Ting-Ting`  text to speech language in osx. 
- setup Chinese dictation is osx preferences.

- Enable Pinyin Chinese simplified keyboard in osx, with all caps as a switch between keyboard. 

- use double click `fn` twice to start dictation.
- or type using chinese keyboard and Pinyin carachters. 


## TODO: 

- [ ] if you type pinyin, perhaps in another window. then it translates to chinese char, translates to english definition. and then can run say.js on it.  
- [ ] speed control for speech playback, eg with slider? // not urgent
